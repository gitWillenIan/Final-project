This is my final project for CS1051
I didn't have to many diffulties with the pong game besides for
trying to get diffferent gamemodes working properly.
I did have a lot of issues with my first idea but I won't dive into that.
All in all it was fun learning Lua and getting my hands a little more dirty
with object oriented programming. I thought that the classes for each object
was a great way to understand the concepts better. 
Overall it was a very fun and rewarding experience.
